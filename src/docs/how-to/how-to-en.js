  <ib-div class="ib_h3">How to save the invoice?</ib-div>
  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    There are three ways to save the invoice:
    <ib-div class="ib_ul">
      <ib-div class="ib_li">
        1) &nbsp;Save it locally in editable <ib-span class="ib_code">.txt</ib-span> format with the &quot;Save State&quot; button.
      </ib-div>
      <ib-div class="ib_li">
        2) &nbsp;Save it to PDF using PDF printer.
      </ib-div>
      <ib-div class="ib_li">
        3) &nbsp;Save it online to our online invoicing system <ib-span class="ib_a" onclick="window.open('https://invoicebus.com', '_blank')">Invoicebus</ib-span>.
      </ib-div>
    </ib-div>
  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    1) To save the invoice data locally in editable format use the <ib-span class="ib_b">&quot;Save State&quot;</ib-span> button in the top menu and follow the on-screen instructions.
  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    2) Saving the invoice to PDF can be done by using something called PDF Print Driver. This is also known as printing to PDF because the output from the browser is sent to a file instead to a printer. This functionality is built-in in some browsers (like Google Chrome), while in others (like Firefox or Internet Explorer) you have to install PDF printer manually. A good and free PDF printer is <ib-span class="ib_a" onclick="window.open('http://www.bullzip.com', '_blank')">Bullzip</ib-span>. If you already have your PDF printer installed, <ib-span class="ib_b">click &quot;Print&quot;, set the destination printer to &quot;Save as PDF&quot; and click Save</ib-span>.
  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    3) In order to save the invoice online you'll need to create an Invoicebus account first. You can do this by clicking &quot;Save Online&quot; button. Then you'll be taken to a secure page where you can complete your registration and save the invoice. Please note that an online invoice is much more powerful than a static PDF invoice. For example, an online invoice can be edited on-the-fly, sent by email, tracked, and paid directly by Credit card, PayPal or Bitcoin. Here's an <ib-span class="ib_a" onclick="window.open('https://invoicebus.com/demoinvoice/', '_blank')">example</ib-span>.
  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_h3">How can I open already saved local invoice data?</ib-div>
  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    To open local data, click the <ib-span class="ib_b">&quot;Open&quot;</ib-span> button and from the file browser window select the data file you want to open. Note that the file must be previously saved invoice data with <ib-span class="ib_code">.txt</ib-span> extension, otherwise it won't load.
  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    Due to browser privacy restrictions the file <ib-span class="ib_b">must be loaded</ib-span> from the same location as the <ib-span class="ib_code">template.html</ib-span> file (the root directory of the template). So if you want to open data file from other location on your computer, first copy it to the template root folder.
  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_h3">How to restyle the template?</ib-div>
  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    The template is made with simplicity in mind so can be easily customized with your own branding and colors. However, basic knowledge in HTML and CSS is required. 
  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    For smaller modifications (like changing colors, fonts or element sizes) you only need to modify the <ib-span class="ib_code">template.css</ib-span> file. If you want to make bigger structural changes of the layout (deleting or rearranging elements), you'll need to modify the <ib-span class="ib_code">template.html</ib-span> file. We've made a <ib-span class="ib_a" onclick="window.open('https://invoicebus.com/create-html-invoice-template/', '_blank')">guide</ib-span> with best practices on how to create your own template, so feel free to use it as a reference point.
  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    <ib-span class="ib_b">Note:</ib-span> The template is completely separate from its logic, so you don't need to mess up with any programming or JavaScript code.
  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_h3">Do I have to be connected to internet to use it?</ib-div>
  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    Yes, but isn't necessary. In the background the template links to remote JavaScript file (<ib-span class="ib_code">generator.min.js</ib-span>) located on our server from which it pulls all the logic. If for some reason you don't have internet access on your computer, you can <ib-span class="ib_a" onclick="window.open('http://cdn.invoicebus.com/generator/generator.zip', '_blank')">download</ib-span> the script locally, and modify the <ib-span class="ib_code">template.html</ib-span> file to point to the local version of the script.
  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    We generally encourage you to continue using the remote script because any recent updates immediately reflect into the template you're using.
  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_h3">What about the fonts used?</ib-div>
  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    The template uses Google Fonts as they are free and open to everyone. If you want to use the template offline (without being connected to internet) you'll have to download and install the fonts on your local computer (<ib-span class="ib_a" onclick="window.open('http://www.fonts.com/web-fonts/google', '_blank')">SkyFonts</ib-span> is a simple tool that helps you do this easily).
  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_h3">Can I use the JavaScript source code?</ib-div>
  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    Absolutely! In fact, we would be proud if you decide to use it (<ib-span class="ib_a" onclick="window.open('https://github.com/Invoicebus/html-invoice-generator', '_blank')">fork us on GitHub</ib-span>). Whether you choose to use it in commercial or non-commercial project, feel free to give us a shout as we are eager to hear all possibilities how this tool can be used. Sometimes, we may even give you a hand ;)
  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_h3">Support our work</ib-div>
  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    Maintaining this script takes a lot of time and effort to keep it bug free and up to date. All we're asking is a little favor – discrete fine print of our invoicing service at the bottom of the printed document. It would mean the world to us if you leave it there. Thanks!
  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    It's fine even if you decide to avoid giving us credit, so we made this choice easier to you. In the local <ib-span class="ib_code">.txt</ib-span> invoice data file there's a property called <ib-span class="ib_code">invoicebus_fineprint</ib-span> which can be set to <ib-span class="ib_code">true</ib-span> (to show the fine print) or <ib-span class="ib_code">false</ib-span> (to hide the fine print).
  </ib-div>
