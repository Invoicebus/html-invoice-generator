    This action will save the current state of the template to a local <ib-span class="ib_code">.txt</ib-span> file. The data from this file can be used to pre-populate the template fields in the future. This comes handy when you want to save the invoice details such as company address, logo, client info, currency, notes, etc. so you don't need to re-enter them every time.

  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    After clicking the button below, you'll be prompted to save the file. In order to open the file in future make sure you save it in the template root directory. The saved file will store instance of the invoice for record keeping.
